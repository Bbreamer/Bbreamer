I first started in NJDS, the national junior development squad, when I won an online chess tournament called the 72nd National Schools Individual Chess Championships.

### Modelling
Once, I tried a 3D modelling software called "Blender"
As I had no idea of to use blender, I searched up a tutorial on how to make a simple donut, and here's the result!

Not long after that, my dad, who always sees me playing a game called "Minecraft" introduced me to Mine-amator.
It was a software that allowed me to create minecraft animations, so I started creating animations, such as:

### Robotics
Together with my brothers, we formed a team called "Team TBG"
and in this team, I won champion in robot performance in FLL 2020
